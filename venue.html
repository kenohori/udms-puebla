<p><strong>Flying to Puebla</strong>: Puebla International Airport is 25 km west of the centre of the city has flights from the most important Mexican airports and international connections from Houston and Dallas. From the airport, you can take a taxi.</p>

<p><strong>Flying to Mexico City</strong>: The international airport in Mexico City has many more flight options than the one in Puebla, including several direct connections from Europe and Asia. From the bus terminal inside the Mexico City airport, there are frequent 24/7 bus services to Puebla by the company Estrella Roja. It is about a two-hour bus ride to the Poniente 4 bus terminal in central Puebla.</p>

<p><strong>By car from Mexico City</strong>: Puebla can be reached in about two hours from Mexico City by toll highway 150D. About 15 minutes after passing through the San Martín Texmelucan tollbooth, you will see the Volkswagen car factory on your left. Keep going and after 5 minutes take one of the two main avenues to your right: Boulevard Hermanos Serdán or Boulevard Esteban de Antuñano. Both of them will lead you to the centre of Puebla.</p>

You can check if you need a visa in <a href="https://www.timaticweb.com/cgi-bin/tim_website_client.cgi?FullText=1&COUNTRY=MX&SECTION=VI&SUBSECTION=00&user=KLMB2C&subuser=KLMB2C">TimaticWeb</a> or directly from the <a href="http://www.inm.gob.mx/gobmx/word/index.php/paises-requieren-visa-para-mexico/">website</a> of the Mexican National Migration Institute (in Spanish).

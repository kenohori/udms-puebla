<h2>2nd International Conference on Smart Data and Smart Cities</h2>


<h3>About the conference</h3>

<p>A smart city can be defined as a city overlaid by a digital layer, which is used not only for storing city information but overall for its governance. The 2nd International Conference on Smart Data and Smart Cities will present novel research concerning the use of information and communication technologies in Smart Cities, and will also provide a forum for senior researchers to establish collaborations on new research projects in this domain. A smart city cannot be defined without a better involvement of citizens (smart people).</p>
<p>This year's conference will be organised in beautiful Puebla, Mexico, as a collaboration between the Urban Data Management Society, four universities and research centres (<abbr title="Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education">ITESM</abbr>, <abbr title="University of the Americas at Puebla">UDLAP</abbr>, <abbr title="National Institute of Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics">INAOE</abbr> and <abbr title="Meritorious Autonomous University of Puebla">BUAP</abbr>), T-Systems, UDMS and ISPRS.</p>

<h3>Hackathon information</h3>

<h4>Humanitarian Logistics and Technology: Coordinating the Distribution and Delivery of Aid to Disaster Victims</h4>

<p>One of the greatest challenges of disaster response is the collection and timely delivery of supplies to aid the rescue and recovery of the affected population: food, clothing, medical equipment, and rescue equipment, among others. 'Humanitarian Logistics' thus focuses on achieving a process to plan, implement and control the effective and efficient flow of products, materials and information from donors (both individuals and organisations) to those that have been affected. This is done so as to tend to their survival needs as well as possible.</p>

<h4>Objective</h4>

<p>The challenge consists of developing a mobile application that permits collecting in real time the information and data that are generated by the different actors involved in the collection, distribution and delivery of aid in a disaster.</p>

<p>This application must consider a decision support model or tool (optimisation, system dynamics, heuristics-based, or any other that is deemed pertinent) that is developed by the team, achieving an adequate allocation of aid based on the information of the items that have been collected in aid collection centres and those that are still needed in disaster areas.</p>

<h3>From Internet of Things to SmartData for Smart Urban Monitoring</h3>
<h4>Emmanuel Gastaud</h4>
Digital Services Development Unit, Digital Innovation and IT Department<br />
Métropole de Lyon, France<br />
<a href="https://www.aderly.com/sectors__trashed/digital/lyon-digital-hub/">https://www.aderly.com/sectors__trashed/digital/lyon-digital-hub/</a><br /><br />

<p>Cities are facing some of the major challenges of our time: global warming, pollution, waste management, energy efficiency. The territory of the Metropolis of Lyon, France, which brings together 59 municipalities, for a total of 1.3 million inhabitants, has launched a smart city policy aimed, among other things, at finding solutions for these issues. The data platform set up in 2013 is one of the cornerstones of this policy. In this context, the Metropolis of Lyon is deploying solutions that will enable, through the collection of new data, to implement monitoring and action tools in several fields.</p>
<p>As part of a European innovation project called "bIoTope", focused on the development of new services based on the Internet of Things, a multidisciplinary team is implementing a system to mitigate the effects of global warming in the city. Thanks to various connected objects allowing a true monitoring of the trees, and by using different data sources, an automatic and intelligent irrigation system is developed. In the field of waste management, several hundred containers in which the inhabitants throw away their used glass for recycling will soon be equipped with fill rate sensors. The main objective is to have this network of sensors interact easily with the container collection trucks. Expected results are an optimization of the collection, thus less fuel consumed, less noise, less traffic congestion.</p>
<p>The Metropolis of Lyon also participates in the "Smarter Together" project, focused on the development of intelligent duplicable solutions for cities, in the field of energy. A digital tool for analyzing consumption and energy production at the level of a neighborhood is currently being developed. This requires both interfaces with multiple partners, the development of a data model reflecting the reality of the terrain, from the sensors to the buildings, and the implementation of a visualization tool.</p>

<h3>SmartSDK: a FIWARE-based platform for smart services on security, health and mobility</h3>

<p>The internet is a magical place where just about everything is possible. What is your vision for the open internet? What is still missing in your online life? What can you make possible tomorrow that cannot be done today? FIWARE is a technological platform of Future Internet, based on Cloud Computing, using OpenStack (open cloud computing) where software development and hardware integrate components such as accelerators or enablers that serve to implement applications in different application domains, with emphasis in Smart Cities. Currently urban systems are concentrators of facilities for citizens, such as public transport and services; however, cities are also big concentrators of problems derived of high concentration of population, such as the pollution, mobility, security, energy management, etc. FIWARE promotes the use of future internet technologies to generate innovative smart services for cities, especially for mobility, security and health. The components, technologies and applications developed around our technology can be opened or marketed in a closed way.</p>

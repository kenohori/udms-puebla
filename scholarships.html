<h2>Second author fee discount</h2>

<p>In case you are co-author of an accepted paper for presentation at the 2nd International Conference on Smart Data and Smart Cities you could have a 30% reduction in registration fees as long as another of your co-authors has paid the full registration fee. Example, the paper <em>Implementing Smart Cities</em> by Juliette, John and Michael has been accepted for its presentation at the conference. As soon as one of the three authors pays a <strong>standard fee</strong> registration, the two others can pay a <strong>second author fee</strong> in order to attend. Co-authors must agree who should pay for the <strong>standard fee</strong> registration.</p>
